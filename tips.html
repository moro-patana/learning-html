                            Use a code editor that has auto-completion. Auto-completion allows you to start typing a tag or attribute 
                            and the software predicts what youâ€™re typing and finishes it for you. This means you can type just a couple of characters and the return key to type considerably longer bits of code.

                            Use emmet: You write simple abbreviations and just press 
                            <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> or any other other supported keyboard shortcut 
                            and Emmet expands the simple abbreviations into complex HTML
                            and CSS code snippets. Emmet will make your HTML and CSS workflow much faster.

                            Tool like LESS.js can drastically increase your coding speed. 
                            Less is a dynamic preprocessor style sheet language that can be compiled into Cascading Style Sheets and run 
                            on the client side or server side.
